I think that the codealong was nice to follow. It was a good introduction to jaclang and working with LLMs.
I think it was really cool to be able to create a software that could prompt LLMs really quickly.
I was surprised how little code it takes to interact with the LLM libraries. The accuracy of the models isn't the greatest but
still impressive how easy it was to make the webapp. I thought it was cool that there is a feature to prompt the models
with documents for answers rather than just text from the user. My only issues with jaclang is that it was difficult
for me to figure out how most of the syntax works and the errors that came up. I had a hard time figuring out the syntax
for some of the code that I wrote.
